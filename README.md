#### Fuzzy Information Discrimination Measures and Their Application to Low Dimensional Embedding Construction in the UMAP Algorithm

The simplest way to get started is to install the following components:
- [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)
- [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)

Then, type the following in your terminal from repository root:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:worldbeater/umap-losses.git
git submodule update --init --recursive
make notebook
```
