### Fuzzy Information Discrimination Measures and Their Application to Low Dimensional Embedding Construction in the UMAP Algorithm

Code for the methods and algorithms described in the paper "Fuzzy Information Discrimination Measures and Their Application to Low Dimensional Embedding Construction in the UMAP Algorithm" [[1](https://doi.org/10.3390/jimaging8040113)]. See [[2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03426)] for the original UMAP algorithm description.

### Getting Started

1. Install [Docker CE](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [GNU make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/).
2. Clone the repository, then clone the submodules using `git submodule update --init --recursive`
3. Run `make notebook` from repository root, run the notebooks.
